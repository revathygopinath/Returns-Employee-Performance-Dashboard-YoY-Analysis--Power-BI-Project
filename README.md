# Returns-Employee-Performance-Dashboard-YoY-Analysis--Power-BI-Project
Power BI project analyzing product returns (2014â€“2016). Includes Return Rate %, YoY comparisons, employee-level contributions, average return value, and seasonal trends. Interactive dashboard built with DAX measures and storytelling insights.
# ðŸ“Š Returns Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing product returns over a 3-year period (2014â€“2016) using Power BI.  
The dashboard provides key insights into **return rates, employee contributions, average return value, and seasonal return patterns**, enabling better understanding of return trends and business impact.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Track **Return Rate %** and compare with last yearâ€™s performance (YoY).  
- Monitor **Total Returned Orders** vs. **Total Transactions**.  
- Identify **employee-level contribution** to returns.  
- Visualize **monthly return trends with YoY overlay** to detect seasonal patterns.  
- Build an **interactive and story-driven dashboard** to support decision-making.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Orders data** â€“ customer transactions with product, sales, profit, and discount details (2013â€“2015)  
- **People data** â€“ employee to region mapping  
- **Returns data** â€“ records of returned orders linked by Order ID  
- **Date table** â€“ created in Power BI using DAX to enable time intelligence and YoY analysis
